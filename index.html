			<h2>Where do elephants live?</h2>
			<p>Elephants live throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.</p>
			<p>They are found in savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes.</p>

			<h2>How do elephants grow up?</h2>
			<p>Calves grow up in family groups. The family group consists of multiple female adults (called cows). The oldest cow is called a matriarch, and is the leader of the group. Family groups do not have male adults (called bulls). Calves get a lot of attention, and rely on their mothers for up to three years. Once they have reached puberty, males leave their family group. They then live by themselves or with other males. Bulls only interact with other family groups when mating. In the wild, elephants can live up to 70 years.</p>

			<h2>How do elephants communicate?</h2>
			<p>Elephants use both infrasound and seismic communication (over long distances). They also appear to have self-awareness and sympathy.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Are elephants important?</h2>
			<p>Elephants are a type of species called a keystone species. That means it has such a large effect on the environment, that the environment wouldn't be the same without it (in bad ways).</p>
			<p>African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered, whereas African forest elephants are listed as critically endangered.</p>
