			<p>Now that we know that we need to help elephants, let's take a look how.</p>
		</section>
		<h2>Don't buy ivory.</h2>
		<p>Seriously, don't. Ivory is the sole reason poachers kill elephants. Essentially, they're killing the elephants for their teeth. Despite the fact that new ivory is strictly banned, antique ivory can still be sold legally. The regulations say that ivory must be 100 years old to qualify as antique, but it's still not a good idea.</p>
		<h2>What has ivory traditionally been used for?</h2>
		<p>That's a good question. According to <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/ways-to-help-elephants-4864223" target="_blank"  tabindex="4">treehugger.com</a>, "Ivory has been traditionally used for jewelry, billiard balls, pool cues, dominoes, fans, piano keys, and carved trinkets."</p>
		<h2>Buy elephant-friendly coffee and timber.</h2>
		<p>Lots of times, coffee and wood are grown in certain plantations. However, these "certain plantations" often destroy elephant habitats. If you want to help on this matter, make sure to buy <abbr title="Forest Stewardship Council">FSC</abbr> certified wood and certified fair trade coffee.</p>
		<h2>The plight of captive elephants</h2>
		<p>We all like to go to zoos. However, zoos are messing with the species, which makes elephants rely too much on humans (and they forget their hunting skills). Plus, these elephants are often taken from the wild. Circuses, on the other hand, also take elephants from the wild, and ask them to perform tricks. You can do your part by not going to any circuses that use animals, and also boycotting zoos that don't offer sufficient space for these animals to live in social groups, and zoos where the elephants aren't allowed to be in control of their own lives.</p>
		<h2>Support conservation efforts</h2>
		<p>Unfortunately, all of us can't be conservationists, but meanwhile, here are some organizations dedicated to helping elephants:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.elephant-conservation.org"  tabindex="5">International Elephant Foundation</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/about_us.asp" tabindex="6">Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.awf.org"  tabindex="7">African Wildlife Foundation</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.elephanttrust.org" tabindex="8">Amboseli Trust for Elephants</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>"Adopt" an elephant</h2>
		<p>Unfortunately, we can't take home a cute elephant, and adopt it. But here are some organizations that offer elephant adoptions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://gifts.worldwildlife.org/gift-center/gifts/Species-Adoptions/African-Elephant.aspx" tabindex="9">International Elephant Foundation</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://worldanimalfoundation.homestead.com/adoptanelephant.html" tabindex="10">World Animal Foundation</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.bornfree.org.uk/give/adopt-an-animal/african-elephant/" tabindex="11">Born Free</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Get involved with Roots & Shoots</h2>
		<p>According to <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/ways-to-help-elephants-4864223" target="_blank"  tabindex="12">treehugger.com</a>, "Founded in 1991 by Dr. Jane Goodall and a group of Tanzanian students, <a href="https://rootsandshoots.org" tabindex="13">Roots & Shoots</a> is a youth program created to incite positive change. There are hundreds of thousands of kids in more than 120 countries in the Roots & Shoots network, all working to create a better world."</p>
